# asl.sh

Simple screen recording script (literally 2 lines), meant to replace [original asl](https://github.com/skuzzymiglet/asl) which was bloated and overcomplicated and written in way too much Python. This is just ffmpeg x11grab, sped up and run under cpulimit.

## Dependencies

`ffmpeg` and `cpulimit`

## Usage

Copy it somewhere, run it one-off or always with a DE autostart, WM config or systemd service, make some alias if you want

## Output

It outputs `webm`s in `$HOME/screenlapse/`
